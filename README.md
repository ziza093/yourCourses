# yourCourses
A small app which takes the uni table and extract only the courses your class should attend.

To run the program I suggest you clone the repository. Create a python virtual enviroment.
Install there the libraries you need to run the code. And then you are good to go.

STEP BY STEP walkthrough:

DISCLAIMER: The following suggestions are made just for you to make an idea about what you need to do.
There could be different ways to install the libraries and run the program. That is just my way of doing it.
Feel free to do it whatever mode you want to.

! As of for now it doesnt seem to work on Windows systems (at least the ones I tested). 


1. clone the repo on your system
2. create a venv and activate it 

--- suggestion ---
* go into the dir where the repo is cloned
* run the following: 
- python3 -m venv venv
- source venv/bin/activate

3. install the missing libraries

--- suggestion ---
* pip3 install requests
* pip3 install openpyxl

-- or just install them from the requirements file --
* pip install -r requirements.txt

4. run the program

--- suggestion ---
*  python3 main.py


(*) if you want to close the venv, run:
* deactivate
